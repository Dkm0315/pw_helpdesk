## 🎯 **What We Built & How It Works**

### **Our Customizations:**
1. **HD Team** → Added `custom_user_assignment` field (link to Dynamic User Assignment)
2. **HD Service Level Agreement** → Added 3 fields:
   - `custom_applicable_categories` (Table MultiSelect)
   - `custom_auto_assign_team` (Link to HD Team)  
   - `custom_assignment_rule` (Link to Assignment Rule)
3. **Assignment Rule** → Added `custom_user_assignment` field (already exists in your setup)

### **The Complete Flow:**
1. **User creates ticket** with category "AC Issue"
2. **System finds SLA** containing that category
3. **SLA applies automatically** + team assigned from SLA
4. **Team's Dynamic User Assignment** syncs users to team
5. **Team's assignment rule** assigns specific agents
6. **HD Agent records** created automatically
7. **User gets real-time feedback** about all assignments
